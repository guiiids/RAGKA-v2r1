# Batch Evaluation Report

## Query

what is ilab

## Parameters

- Temperature: 0.3
- Top P: 1
- Max Tokens: 1000
- Runs: 2

## Prompt Evaluation

[RAG3] 1. **Analysis of how the parameter differences affected the outputs:**

   In this case, both batches have identical parameters:
   - System Prompt: Default prompt
   - Temperature: 0.3
   - Top P: 1
   - Max Tokens: 1000
   - Number of runs: 0

   Given that all parameters are the same, any differences in the sample responses can be attributed to inherent variability in the model's outputs rather than parameter settings.

2. **Which parameter settings worked better for this query and why:**

   Since both batches used identical parameter settings, it is not possible to determine which set of parameters worked better based on these samples alone. Both responses provide a clear and concise explanation of what iLab is, including its functionalities and resources available for different user roles.

3. **Recommendations for optimal parameters for similar queries:**

   For queries like "what is ilab," where a detailed yet concise response is needed:

   - **Temperature:** Keep it low (around 0.3) to ensure that the output remains focused and coherent.
   - **Top P:** Set to 1 to allow for diverse word choices while maintaining relevance.
   - **Max Tokens:** A higher limit (e.g., 1000) ensures that there is enough space for comprehensive answers without cutting off important information.
   
Additionally, consider increasing the number of runs (e.g., setting it to more than one) if you want multiple variations of responses from which you can choose the best one.

These settings should help generate reliable and informative responses consistently across similar informational queries.
