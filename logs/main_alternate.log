CLI Language Reference\n\n70 Writing Macros 01-999073-00 A0998\n\nIn the CLI programming language, the same program is written as follows:\n\nprintf (\"hello, world\");\n\nMissing is the #include <stdio.h> statement because CLI includes the standard\nstdio.h, math.h, stdlib.h, and string.h libraries automatically. In fact, there is\nno #include statement in CLI because definitions happen by means of the run\nstatement. The equivalent expression to #include <file.h> is run file.h.\n\nAlso missing is the main(){ } syntax. CLI has no main function. Usually, main is an\nin entry point for loaders of compiled code. The interpreter does not need an entry point.\n\nFinally, notice that the printf() statements in CLI are similar to C, except CLI does not\nuse \\n to create a linefeed. Rather, the linefeed is implied in each printf() statement.\nThe escape sequence \\ does not exist in CLI.\n\nVariables and Arithmetic Expressions\n\nThe next program example uses the formula C = (5/9) (F-32) to print a table of Fahrenheit\ntemperatures and their Celsius equivalents. \n**The C program is written as follows:**\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table for fahr =0,20,...,300 */\n\nmain()\n\n{\n\nint fahr, celsius;\n\nint lower, upper, step;\n\nlower = 0;\n\nupper = 300;\n\nstep = 20;\n\nfahr = lower;\n\nwhile (fahr <= upper) {\n\ncelsius = 5 ( (fahr-32) / 9;\n\nprintf (\"%d\\t%d\\n\", fahr, celsius);\n\nfahr = fahr + step;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nA similar program written in the \n**CLI language is as follows:**\n\n/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table for fahr =0,20,...,300 */\n\nlower = 0;\n\nupper = 300;\n\nstep = 20;</source>\n\n<source id=\"4\">\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd

The distinction is that the \naction specified for rtoutput occurs for each sample submitted. A single press of the \naddExp button can cause many experiments to be submitted, if, for example, multiple \nexperiments and/or multiple locations were specified. The rtoutput will occur once for \neach submitted experiment.

These attributes are magical commands that will be sent to VNMR \nwhen the button is selected and deselected, respectively. The value of the attribute can \ninclude any other attribute from that group.\n\nset addExp(id) addExp\n\nset addExp(label) \"Add Entry\"\n\nset addExp(rtoutput) {write('alpha','loc=$loc(val)')}</source>\n</context>\n<user_query>\nhello\n</user_query>"

CDS says, 'Ahh yes, I see that - I have found the license\nserver at <OriginalName> and \n**I will launch.'?TYPICAL PROBLEM/SCENARIO:**\n?Problems arise, however,\nwhen the computer HOSTNAME is changed AFTER OpenLAB had been installed. When the HOSTNAME is\nchanged (perhaps by the customer's IT department), the shared services entry in the CDS does not. So the\nCDS has no idea that it needs to go somewhere else to find the required servers. The conversation is\nthus:?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument controller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey\nnetwork, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network replies 'I have no idea what\n<OriginalName> is, that host does not exist on the network.'?\n3. CDS says, 'Dang, well I guess I can't start\nthen because my license server and instrument controller are missing. \n**Woe is me.'?SYMPTOMS:**\nC.01.05\nexhibits TWO classic symptoms whenever the Instrument Controller and License Server cannot be\nresolved:?\n1. The OpenLAB Control Panel becomes unresponsive. It will alternate between 10 seconds of\ncompletely unresponsive 'Not Responding' status. Then a flash moment where the software seems to work\nfine. Then again another 10 seconds of total non-responsiveness. This cycle repeats forever.?\n2. The\n'Configure Instrument,' 'Launch,' and 'Launch Offline' buttons become grayed out.?\n**Recommendations:**\nCDS =</source>\n\n<source id=\"2\">\\\u0302;<7\ufffdl\u0300a89b:\u0300a\ufffd\ufffdRJOLJ,?@>@@C)@G/O\ufffd >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH0,-J--/O*+Q >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH/WA/E,CE >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHD)++\ufffdS-V\ufffd/OLAQ>>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHAEJ@-?/@/ \ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH1\ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH3 \ufffdr55W3\ufffd5*J@@/E r35W\ufffd5HOC*,+/H\ufffd \ufffds3\ufffdW45\ufffd*J@@/E\n\n\ufffdk\ufffd\ufffd89\ufffdv\\\ufffd\u0300\ufffd\\7\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd9\u0300ac;87a\ufffd\ufffd8b\ufffdk8b\ufffd]8b\u0300\ufffdt\u0300c\\;\ufffda\ufffd8b;7k8b]\\c;87\ufffd\ufffd\u0302\ufffd\u0300\\a\u0300\ufffd:87c\\:c\ufffd9a\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$yg(gX\ufffdRCOO/EG,J+\ufffdgJEi/A,@?\n\n\ufffd\"\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffdy+C*J+\ufffdgJEGCO\ufffdBL/G,J+,-A \ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffdI,CGC+)O@-\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdRC@-)OJ*+/-\ufffd(EC\ufffd \ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$I,CGC+)O@-\ufffd(EC0)GA\ufffdgJ@J?/E</source>\n\n<source id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r\n    /HRV <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></source>\n</context>\n<user_query>\nhey\n</user_query>"

In a client/server environment, you take the HOSTNAME of the computer running the 'shared\nservices' and provide that to the CDS so it knows where to go for a license and the 'Instrument Controller.'?In\na workstation environment, \n**CDS launches thusly:**\n?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument\ncontroller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey network, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network\nreplies 'You, silly. You ARE <OriginalName>!'.?\n3. CDS says, 'Ahh yes, I see that - I have found the license\nserver at <OriginalName> and \n**I will launch.'?TYPICAL PROBLEM/SCENARIO:**\n?Problems arise, however,\nwhen the computer HOSTNAME is changed AFTER OpenLAB had been installed. When the HOSTNAME is\nchanged (perhaps by the customer's IT department), the shared services entry in the CDS does not. So the\nCDS has no idea that it needs to go somewhere else to find the required servers. The conversation is\nthus:?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument controller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey\nnetwork, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network replies 'I have no idea what\n<OriginalName> is, that host does not exist on the network.'?\n3. CDS says, 'Dang, well I guess I can't start\nthen because my license server and instrument controller are missing. \n**Woe is me.'?SYMPTOMS:**\nC.01.05\nexhibits TWO classic symptoms whenever the Instrument Controller and License Server cannot be\nresolved:?\n1. The OpenLAB Control Panel becomes unresponsive. It will alternate between 10 seconds of\ncompletely unresponsive 'Not Responding' status. Then a flash moment where the software seems to work\nfine. Then again another 10 seconds of total non-responsiveness. This cycle repeats forever.?\n2. The\n'Configure Instrument,' 'Launch,' and 'Launch Offline' buttons become grayed out.?\n**Recommendations:**\nCDS =</source>\n\n<source id=\"2\">\\\u0302;<7\ufffdl\u0300a89b:\u0300a\ufffd\ufffdRJOLJ,?@>@@C)@G/O\ufffd >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH0,-J--/O*+Q >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH/WA/E,CE >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHD)++\ufffdS-V\ufffd/OLAQ>>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHAEJ@-?/@/ \ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH1\ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH3 \ufffdr55W3\ufffd5*J@@/E r35W\ufffd5HOC*,+/H\ufffd \ufffds3\ufffdW45\ufffd*J@@/E\n\n\ufffdk\ufffd\ufffd89\ufffdv\\\ufffd\u0300\ufffd\\7\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd9\u0300ac;87a\ufffd\ufffd8b\ufffdk8b\ufffd]8b\u0300\ufffdt\u0300c\\;\ufffda\ufffd8b;7k8b]\\c;87\ufffd\ufffd\u0302\ufffd\u0300\\a\u0300\ufffd:87c\\:c\ufffd9a\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$yg(gX\ufffdRCOO/EG,J+\ufffdgJEi/A,@?\n\n\ufffd\"\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffdy+C*J+\ufffdgJEGCO\ufffdBL/G,J+,-A \ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffdI,CGC+)O@-\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdRC@-)OJ*+/-\ufffd(EC\ufffd \ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$I,CGC+)O@-\ufffd(EC0)GA\ufffdgJ@J?/E</source>\n\n<source id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r\n    /HRV <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></source>\n</context>\n<user_query>\nhey\n</user_query>"

In a client/server environment, you take the HOSTNAME of the computer running the 'shared\nservices' and provide that to the CDS so it knows where to go for a license and the 'Instrument Controller.'?In\na workstation environment, \n**CDS launches thusly:**\n?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument\ncontroller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey network, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network\nreplies 'You, silly. You ARE <OriginalName>!'.?\n3. CDS says, 'Ahh yes, I see that - I have found the license\nserver at <OriginalName> and \n**I will launch.'?TYPICAL PROBLEM/SCENARIO:**\n?Problems arise, however,\nwhen the computer HOSTNAME is changed AFTER OpenLAB had been installed. When the HOSTNAME is\nchanged (perhaps by the customer's IT department), the shared services entry in the CDS does not. So the\nCDS has no idea that it needs to go somewhere else to find the required servers. The conversation is\nthus:?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument controller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey\nnetwork, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network replies 'I have no idea what\n<OriginalName> is, that host does not exist on the network.'?\n3. CDS says, 'Dang, well I guess I can't start\nthen because my license server and instrument controller are missing. \n**Woe is me.'?SYMPTOMS:**\nC.01.05\nexhibits TWO classic symptoms whenever the Instrument Controller and License Server cannot be\nresolved:?\n1. The OpenLAB Control Panel becomes unresponsive. It will alternate between 10 seconds of\ncompletely unresponsive 'Not Responding' status. Then a flash moment where the software seems to work\nfine. Then again another 10 seconds of total non-responsiveness. This cycle repeats forever.?\n2. The\n'Configure Instrument,' 'Launch,' and 'Launch Offline' buttons become grayed out.?\n**Recommendations:**\nCDS =</source>\n\n<source id=\"2\">\\\u0302;<7\ufffdl\u0300a89b:\u0300a\ufffd\ufffdRJOLJ,?@>@@C)@G/O\ufffd >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH0,-J--/O*+Q >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH/WA/E,CE >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHD)++\ufffdS-V\ufffd/OLAQ>>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHAEJ@-?/@/ \ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH1\ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH3 \ufffdr55W3\ufffd5*J@@/E r35W\ufffd5HOC*,+/H\ufffd \ufffds3\ufffdW45\ufffd*J@@/E\n\n\ufffdk\ufffd\ufffd89\ufffdv\\\ufffd\u0300\ufffd\\7\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd9\u0300ac;87a\ufffd\ufffd8b\ufffdk8b\ufffd]8b\u0300\ufffdt\u0300c\\;\ufffda\ufffd8b;7k8b]\\c;87\ufffd\ufffd\u0302\ufffd\u0300\\a\u0300\ufffd:87c\\:c\ufffd9a\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$yg(gX\ufffdRCOO/EG,J+\ufffdgJEi/A,@?\n\n\ufffd\"\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffdy+C*J+\ufffdgJEGCO\ufffdBL/G,J+,-A \ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffdI,CGC+)O@-\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdRC@-)OJ*+/-\ufffd(EC\ufffd \ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$I,CGC+)O@-\ufffd(EC0)GA\ufffdgJ@J?/E</source>\n\n<source id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r\n    /HRV <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></source>\n</context>\n<user_query>\nhey\n</user_query>"

In a client/server environment, you take the HOSTNAME of the computer running the 'shared\nservices' and provide that to the CDS so it knows where to go for a license and the 'Instrument Controller.'?In\na workstation environment, \n**CDS launches thusly:**\n?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument\ncontroller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey network, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network\nreplies 'You, silly. You ARE <OriginalName>!'.?\n3. CDS says, 'Ahh yes, I see that - I have found the license\nserver at <OriginalName> and \n**I will launch.'?TYPICAL PROBLEM/SCENARIO:**\n?Problems arise, however,\nwhen the computer HOSTNAME is changed AFTER OpenLAB had been installed. When the HOSTNAME is\nchanged (perhaps by the customer's IT department), the shared services entry in the CDS does not. So the\nCDS has no idea that it needs to go somewhere else to find the required servers. The conversation is\nthus:?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument controller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey\nnetwork, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network replies 'I have no idea what\n<OriginalName> is, that host does not exist on the network.'?\n3. CDS says, 'Dang, well I guess I can't start\nthen because my license server and instrument controller are missing. \n**Woe is me.'?SYMPTOMS:**\nC.01.05\nexhibits TWO classic symptoms whenever the Instrument Controller and License Server cannot be\nresolved:?\n1. The OpenLAB Control Panel becomes unresponsive. It will alternate between 10 seconds of\ncompletely unresponsive 'Not Responding' status. Then a flash moment where the software seems to work\nfine. Then again another 10 seconds of total non-responsiveness. This cycle repeats forever.?\n2. The\n'Configure Instrument,' 'Launch,' and 'Launch Offline' buttons become grayed out.?\n**Recommendations:**\nCDS =</source>\n\n<source id=\"2\">\\\u0302;<7\ufffdl\u0300a89b:\u0300a\ufffd\ufffdRJOLJ,?@>@@C)@G/O\ufffd >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH0,-J--/O*+Q >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH/WA/E,CE >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHD)++\ufffdS-V\ufffd/OLAQ>>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHAEJ@-?/@/ \ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH1\ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH3 \ufffdr55W3\ufffd5*J@@/E r35W\ufffd5HOC*,+/H\ufffd \ufffds3\ufffdW45\ufffd*J@@/E\n\n\ufffdk\ufffd\ufffd89\ufffdv\\\ufffd\u0300\ufffd\\7\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd9\u0300ac;87a\ufffd\ufffd8b\ufffdk8b\ufffd]8b\u0300\ufffdt\u0300c\\;\ufffda\ufffd8b;7k8b]\\c;87\ufffd\ufffd\u0302\ufffd\u0300\\a\u0300\ufffd:87c\\:c\ufffd9a\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$yg(gX\ufffdRCOO/EG,J+\ufffdgJEi/A,@?\n\n\ufffd\"\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffdy+C*J+\ufffdgJEGCO\ufffdBL/G,J+,-A \ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffdI,CGC+)O@-\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdRC@-)OJ*+/-\ufffd(EC\ufffd \ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$I,CGC+)O@-\ufffd(EC0)GA\ufffdgJ@J?/E</source>\n\n<source id=\"3\">/HEB <FEFF05D405E905EA05DE05E905D5002005D105D405D205D305E805D505EA002005D005DC05D4002005DB05D305D9002005DC05D905E605D505E8002005DE05E105DE05DB05D9002000410064006F006200650020005000440046002005E205D105D505E8002005D405D305E405E105D4002005D005D905DB05D505EA05D905EA002005D105DE05D305E405E105D505EA002005E905D505DC05D705E005D905D505EA002005D505DB05DC05D9002005D405D205D405D4002E002005DE05E105DE05DB05D9002005D4002D005000440046002005E905E005D505E605E805D905DD002005E005D905EA05E005D905DD002005DC05E405EA05D905D705D4002005D105D005DE05E605E205D505EA0020004100630072006F006200610074002005D5002D00410064006F00620065002000520065006100640065007200200035002E0030002005D505D205E805E105D005D505EA002005DE05EA05E705D305DE05D505EA002005D905D505EA05E8002E>\r\n    /HRV <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></source>\n</context>\n<user_query>\nhey\n</user_query>"

CDS says, 'Ahh yes, I see that - I have found the license\nserver at <OriginalName> and \n**I will launch.'?TYPICAL PROBLEM/SCENARIO:**\n?Problems arise, however,\nwhen the computer HOSTNAME is changed AFTER OpenLAB had been installed. When the HOSTNAME is\nchanged (perhaps by the customer's IT department), the shared services entry in the CDS does not. So the\nCDS has no idea that it needs to go somewhere else to find the required servers. The conversation is\nthus:?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument controller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey\nnetwork, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network replies 'I have no idea what\n<OriginalName> is, that host does not exist on the network.'?\n3. CDS says, 'Dang, well I guess I can't start\nthen because my license server and instrument controller are missing. \n**Woe is me.'?SYMPTOMS:**\nC.01.05\nexhibits TWO classic symptoms whenever the Instrument Controller and License Server cannot be\nresolved:?\n1. The OpenLAB Control Panel becomes unresponsive. It will alternate between 10 seconds of\ncompletely unresponsive 'Not Responding' status. Then a flash moment where the software seems to work\nfine. Then again another 10 seconds of total non-responsiveness. This cycle repeats forever.?\n2. The\n'Configure Instrument,' 'Launch,' and 'Launch Offline' buttons become grayed out.?\n**Recommendations:**\nCDS =</source>\n\n<source id=\"2\">\\\u0302;<7\ufffdl\u0300a89b:\u0300a\ufffd\ufffdRJOLJ,?@>@@C)@G/O\ufffd >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH0,-J--/O*+Q >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH/WA/E,CE >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHD)++\ufffdS-V\ufffd/OLAQ>>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHAEJ@-?/@/ \ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH1\ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH3 \ufffdr55W3\ufffd5*J@@/E r35W\ufffd5HOC*,+/H\ufffd \ufffds3\ufffdW45\ufffd*J@@/E\n\n\ufffdk\ufffd\ufffd89\ufffdv\\\ufffd\u0300\ufffd\\7\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd9\u0300ac;87a\ufffd\ufffd8b\ufffdk8b\ufffd]8b\u0300\ufffdt\u0300c\\;\ufffda\ufffd8b;7k8b]\\c;87\ufffd\ufffd\u0302\ufffd\u0300\\a\u0300\ufffd:87c\\:c\ufffd9a\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$yg(gX\ufffdRCOO/EG,J+\ufffdgJEi/A,@?\n\n\ufffd\"\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffdy+C*J+\ufffdgJEGCO\ufffdBL/G,J+,-A \ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffdI,CGC+)O@-\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdRC@-)OJ*+/-\ufffd(EC\ufffd \ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$I,CGC+)O@-\ufffd(EC0)GA\ufffdgJ@J?/E</source>\n\n<source id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r\n    /HRV <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></source>\n</context>\n<user_query>\nhey\n</user_query>"

For example:\n    \n    User: \"What are the key features of Product X?\"\n    Assistant: \"Product X has three main features: cloud integration [1], advanced analytics [2], and mobile support [3].\"\n    \n    User: \"Tell me more about the mobile support.\"\n    Assistant: \"The mobile support feature of Product X includes cross-platform compatibility, offline mode, and push notifications [3].\"\n    \n    ### Output:\n\n    Provide a clear and direct response to the user's query, including inline citations in the format [id] only when the <source> tag with id attribute is present in the context. Remember to include citations in ALL responses, including follow-up questions.\n    \n    <context>\n\n    {{CONTEXT}}\n    </context>\n    \n    <user_query>\n\n    {{QUERY}}\n    </user_query>\n    "

In a client/server environment, you take the HOSTNAME of the computer running the 'shared\nservices' and provide that to the CDS so it knows where to go for a license and the 'Instrument Controller.'?In\na workstation environment, \n**CDS launches thusly:**\n?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument\ncontroller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey network, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network\nreplies 'You, silly. You ARE <OriginalName>!'.?\n3. CDS says, 'Ahh yes, I see that - I have found the license\nserver at <OriginalName> and \n**I will launch.'?TYPICAL PROBLEM/SCENARIO:**\n?Problems arise, however,\nwhen the computer HOSTNAME is changed AFTER OpenLAB had been installed. When the HOSTNAME is\nchanged (perhaps by the customer's IT department), the shared services entry in the CDS does not. So the\nCDS has no idea that it needs to go somewhere else to find the required servers. The conversation is\nthus:?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument controller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey\nnetwork, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network replies 'I have no idea what\n<OriginalName> is, that host does not exist on the network.'?\n3. CDS says, 'Dang, well I guess I can't start\nthen because my license server and instrument controller are missing. \n**Woe is me.'?SYMPTOMS:**\nC.01.05\nexhibits TWO classic symptoms whenever the Instrument Controller and License Server cannot be\nresolved:?\n1. The OpenLAB Control Panel becomes unresponsive. It will alternate between 10 seconds of\ncompletely unresponsive 'Not Responding' status. Then a flash moment where the software seems to work\nfine. Then again another 10 seconds of total non-responsiveness. This cycle repeats forever.?\n2. The\n'Configure Instrument,' 'Launch,' and 'Launch Offline' buttons become grayed out.?\n**Recommendations:**\nCDS =</source>\n\n<source id=\"2\">\\\u0302;<7\ufffdl\u0300a89b:\u0300a\ufffd\ufffdRJOLJ,?@>@@C)@G/O\ufffd >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH0,-J--/O*+Q >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH/WA/E,CE >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHD)++\ufffdS-V\ufffd/OLAQ>>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHAEJ@-?/@/ \ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH1\ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH3 \ufffdr55W3\ufffd5*J@@/E r35W\ufffd5HOC*,+/H\ufffd \ufffds3\ufffdW45\ufffd*J@@/E\n\n\ufffdk\ufffd\ufffd89\ufffdv\\\ufffd\u0300\ufffd\\7\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd9\u0300ac;87a\ufffd\ufffd8b\ufffdk8b\ufffd]8b\u0300\ufffdt\u0300c\\;\ufffda\ufffd8b;7k8b]\\c;87\ufffd\ufffd\u0302\ufffd\u0300\\a\u0300\ufffd:87c\\:c\ufffd9a\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$yg(gX\ufffdRCOO/EG,J+\ufffdgJEi/A,@?\n\n\ufffd\"\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffdy+C*J+\ufffdgJEGCO\ufffdBL/G,J+,-A \ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffdI,CGC+)O@-\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdRC@-)OJ*+/-\ufffd(EC\ufffd \ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$I,CGC+)O@-\ufffd(EC0)GA\ufffdgJ@J?/E</source>\n\n<source id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r\n    /HRV <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></source>\n</context>\n<user_query>\nhey\n</user_query>"

In a client/server environment, you take the HOSTNAME of the computer running the 'shared\nservices' and provide that to the CDS so it knows where to go for a license and the 'Instrument Controller.'?In\na workstation environment, \n**CDS launches thusly:**\n?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument\ncontroller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey network, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network\nreplies 'You, silly. You ARE <OriginalName>!'.?\n3. CDS says, 'Ahh yes, I see that - I have found the license\nserver at <OriginalName> and \n**I will launch.'?TYPICAL PROBLEM/SCENARIO:**\n?Problems arise, however,\nwhen the computer HOSTNAME is changed AFTER OpenLAB had been installed. When the HOSTNAME is\nchanged (perhaps by the customer's IT department), the shared services entry in the CDS does not. So the\nCDS has no idea that it needs to go somewhere else to find the required servers. The conversation is\nthus:?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument controller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey\nnetwork, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network replies 'I have no idea what\n<OriginalName> is, that host does not exist on the network.'?\n3. CDS says, 'Dang, well I guess I can't start\nthen because my license server and instrument controller are missing. \n**Woe is me.'?SYMPTOMS:**\nC.01.05\nexhibits TWO classic symptoms whenever the Instrument Controller and License Server cannot be\nresolved:?\n1.

Entities: Institution: the overall customer organization, which contains the various\n\nentities described below.\n\nCore Facility / Shared Resource: an entity that offers services or access\n\nto resources for customers.\n\nIn iLab, each Core Facility / Shared Resource (Core, for short) has an\n\nonline store-front that customers can use to identify the offerings available and directly order\n\nproducts/services.\n\nFor core administrators and staff, iLab provides workflows to help deliver\n\nservices, manage resources, complete billing and generate reports.\n\nLab/Group: A group of users,\n\nsupervised/managed by a Principal Investigator and/or Lab/Group Managers (see below).\n\n**In iLab,**\n\nLabs/Groups are typically used as the primary way to organize access to Funds (see below) and\n\nmanage financial approvals for purchases at Core Facilities.\n\nDepartment: Institutions can choose\n\nto organize their Labs/Groups into Departments.\n\nThis allows for financial approvals to be escalate\n\nto the departmental level and allows for reporting at this level.\n\n**Note that the use of departments is**\n\noptional.\n\nCenter: A grouping of Labs/Groups and/or Core Facilities, possibly across institutional\n\nboundaries, which can be used to define special price types and subsidies.\n\nUser roles in iLab:\n\nInstitutional Administrator: Someone within an organization using iLab who is responsible for\n\nsupervising the overall usage of iLab.\n\nInstitutional Administrators have certain rights within iLab\n\nthat allow them to report at the institutional level and allows them to manage users and groups\n\nwithin their organization.\n\nPrincipal Investigator (PI): Primary leader of a lab or group within iLab.</source>\n\n<source id=\"2\">below a configurable Approval Threshold (in which case the\n\napproval is performed automatically).\n\nFor more information on request approvals, see Request\n\n**Services .**\n\nFinancial Integration: During the implementation process, iLab can be integrated with\n\nthe customer's financial system.\n\nThe two key areas that are most often integrated are the\n\nautomatic allocation of Funds to specific Labs/Groups and the automatic upload of billing data to\n\nthe customer's internal and/or external billing systems.\n\nID integration: Another common\n\nintegration point is between the customer's authentication system and iLab.\n\n**If an ID integration is**\n\nin place, the customer logs in using their own institution's credentials, rather than obtaining\n\ncredentials from iLab.\n\nPage 2</source>\n\n<source id=\"3\">boundaries, which can be used to define special price types and subsidies.\n\nUser roles in iLab:\n\nInstitutional Administrator: Someone within an organization using iLab who is responsible for\n\nsupervising the overall usage of iLab.\n\nInstitutional Administrators have certain rights within iLab\n\nthat allow them to report at the institutional level and allows them to manage users and groups\n\nwithin their organization.\n\nPrincipal Investigator (PI): Primary leader of a lab or group within iLab.\n\nHas certain rights to manage users in their lab/group and control financial access / approvals.\n\nLab/Group Manager: Administrator of a lab or group, typically a delegate of the PI, with rights\n\nsimilar to the Principal Investigator.\n\nLab/Group Member: Any member of a lab or group that does\n\nnot have any special administrative rights.\n\nCore Administrator: Managers of a Core\n\nFacility/Shared Resource, who have special permissions in iLab to modify the workflow of their\n\ncore and the ability to generate billing events and reports.\n\nCore Member: Staff at a Core\n\nFacility/Shared Resource, with the ability to performs workflow functions (i.e.\n\ncomplete orders,\n\ndeliver services, etc.) but without the administrative permission available to Core Administrators.\n\nCore Customer: Not a role separate from the roles described above, but \"Core Customer \"\n\ndescribes any user of iLab that is in the process of ordering services or securing resources from a\n\n**Page 1**\n\n\n\n**HelpJuice Articles**\n\nCore.\n\nOther terms: Fund: The general term used to describe a way for users to pay for services in\n\niLab.\n\nIn your organization, a Fund may be known as a \"Grant number\", \"Chart Field String\",\n\n\"Speed Code\", \"Account Number\", \"Project ID\" or any other identifier.\n\n**In iLab, Funds are allocated**\n\nto Labs/Groups, and from there assigned to individual Lab/Group

In a client/server environment, you take the HOSTNAME of the computer running the 'shared\nservices' and provide that to the CDS so it knows where to go for a license and the 'Instrument Controller.'?In\na workstation environment, \n**CDS launches thusly:**\n?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument\ncontroller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey network, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network\nreplies 'You, silly. You ARE <OriginalName>!'.?\n3. CDS says, 'Ahh yes, I see that - I have found the license\nserver at <OriginalName> and \n**I will launch.'?TYPICAL PROBLEM/SCENARIO:**\n?Problems arise, however,\nwhen the computer HOSTNAME is changed AFTER OpenLAB had been installed. When the HOSTNAME is\nchanged (perhaps by the customer's IT department), the shared services entry in the CDS does not. So the\nCDS has no idea that it needs to go somewhere else to find the required servers. The conversation is\nthus:?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument controller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey\nnetwork, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network replies 'I have no idea what\n<OriginalName> is, that host does not exist on the network.'?\n3. CDS says, 'Dang, well I guess I can't start\nthen because my license server and instrument controller are missing. \n**Woe is me.'?SYMPTOMS:**\nC.01.05\nexhibits TWO classic symptoms whenever the Instrument Controller and License Server cannot be\nresolved:?\n1. The OpenLAB Control Panel becomes unresponsive. It will alternate between 10 seconds of\ncompletely unresponsive 'Not Responding' status. Then a flash moment where the software seems to work\nfine. Then again another 10 seconds of total non-responsiveness. This cycle repeats forever.?\n2. The\n'Configure Instrument,' 'Launch,' and 'Launch Offline' buttons become grayed out.?\n**Recommendations:**\nCDS =</source>\n\n<source id=\"2\">\\\u0302;<7\ufffdl\u0300a89b:\u0300a\ufffd\ufffdRJOLJ,?@>@@C)@G/O\ufffd >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH0,-J--/O*+Q >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH/WA/E,CE >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHD)++\ufffdS-V\ufffd/OLAQ>>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHAEJ@-?/@/ \ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH1\ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH3 \ufffdr55W3\ufffd5*J@@/E r35W\ufffd5HOC*,+/H\ufffd \ufffds3\ufffdW45\ufffd*J@@/E\n\n\ufffdk\ufffd\ufffd89\ufffdv\\\ufffd\u0300\ufffd\\7\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd9\u0300ac;87a\ufffd\ufffd8b\ufffdk8b\ufffd]8b\u0300\ufffdt\u0300c\\;\ufffda\ufffd8b;7k8b]\\c;87\ufffd\ufffd\u0302\ufffd\u0300\\a\u0300\ufffd:87c\\:c\ufffd9a\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$yg(gX\ufffdRCOO/EG,J+\ufffdgJEi/A,@?\n\n\ufffd\"\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffdy+C*J+\ufffdgJEGCO\ufffdBL/G,J+,-A \ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffdI,CGC+)O@-\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdRC@-)OJ*+/-\ufffd(EC\ufffd \ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$I,CGC+)O@-\ufffd(EC0)GA\ufffdgJ@J?/E</source>\n\n<source id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r\n    /HRV <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></source>\n</context>\n<user_query>\nhey\n</user_query>"

In a client/server environment, you take the HOSTNAME of the computer running the 'shared\nservices' and provide that to the CDS so it knows where to go for a license and the 'Instrument Controller.'?In\na workstation environment, \n**CDS launches thusly:**\n?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument\ncontroller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey network, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network\nreplies 'You, silly. You ARE <OriginalName>!'.?\n3. CDS says, 'Ahh yes, I see that - I have found the license\nserver at <OriginalName> and \n**I will launch.'?TYPICAL PROBLEM/SCENARIO:**\n?Problems arise, however,\nwhen the computer HOSTNAME is changed AFTER OpenLAB had been installed. When the HOSTNAME is\nchanged (perhaps by the customer's IT department), the shared services entry in the CDS does not. So the\nCDS has no idea that it needs to go somewhere else to find the required servers. The conversation is\nthus:?\n1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument controller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey\nnetwork, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?\n2. The network replies 'I have no idea what\n<OriginalName> is, that host does not exist on the network.'?\n3. CDS says, 'Dang, well I guess I can't start\nthen because my license server and instrument controller are missing. \n**Woe is me.'?SYMPTOMS:**\nC.01.05\nexhibits TWO classic symptoms whenever the Instrument Controller and License Server cannot be\nresolved:?\n1. The OpenLAB Control Panel becomes unresponsive. It will alternate between 10 seconds of\ncompletely unresponsive 'Not Responding' status. Then a flash moment where the software seems to work\nfine. Then again another 10 seconds of total non-responsiveness. This cycle repeats forever.?\n2. The\n'Configure Instrument,' 'Launch,' and 'Launch Offline' buttons become grayed out.?\n**Recommendations:**\nCDS =</source>\n\n<source id=\"2\">\\\u0302;<7\ufffdl\u0300a89b:\u0300a\ufffd\ufffdRJOLJ,?@>@@C)@G/O\ufffd >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH0,-J--/O*+Q >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdH/WA/E,CE >>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHD)++\ufffdS-V\ufffd/OLAQ>>F\ufffdS/GACE\ufffdHAEJ@-?/@/ \ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH1\ufffd(E,@A\ufffdJ0S/EA\ufffdH3 \ufffdr55W3\ufffd5*J@@/E r35W\ufffd5HOC*,+/H\ufffd \ufffds3\ufffdW45\ufffd*J@@/E\n\n\ufffdk\ufffd\ufffd89\ufffdv\\\ufffd\u0300\ufffd\\7\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd9\u0300ac;87a\ufffd\ufffd8b\ufffdk8b\ufffd]8b\u0300\ufffdt\u0300c\\;\ufffda\ufffd8b;7k8b]\\c;87\ufffd\ufffd\u0302\ufffd\u0300\\a\u0300\ufffd:87c\\:c\ufffd9a\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$yg(gX\ufffdRCOO/EG,J+\ufffdgJEi/A,@?\n\n\ufffd\"\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffdy+C*J+\ufffdgJEGCO\ufffdBL/G,J+,-A \ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t  \ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffdI,CGC+)O@-\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdRC@-)OJ*+/-\ufffd(EC\ufffd \ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd!\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"#\t$I,CGC+)O@-\ufffd(EC0)GA\ufffdgJ@J?/E</source>\n\n<source id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r\n    /HRV <FEFF005a00610020007300740076006100720061006e006a0065002000410064006f00620065002000500044004600200064006f006b0075006d0065006e0061007400610020007a00610020006b00760061006c00690074006500740061006e0020006900730070006900730020006e006100200070006900730061010d0069006d006100200069006c0069002000700072006f006f006600650072002000750072006501110061006a0069006d0061002e00200020005300740076006f00720065006e0069002000500044004600200064006f006b0075006d0065006e007400690020006d006f006700750020007300650020006f00740076006f00720069007400690020004100630072006f00620061007400200069002000410064006f00620065002000520065006100640065007200200035002e0030002000690020006b00610073006e0069006a0069006d0020007600650072007a0069006a0061006d0061002e></source>\n</context>\n<user_query>\nHEY\n</user_query>"
