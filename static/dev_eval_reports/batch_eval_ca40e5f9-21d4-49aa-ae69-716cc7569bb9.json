      "context": "<source id=\"1\">the same computer as the CDS.?When the\nshared services are installed, they set their address as the HOSTNAME of the computer they are being\ninstalled on. In a client/server environment, you take the HOSTNAME of the computer running the 'shared\nservices' and provide that to the CDS so it knows where to go for a license and the 'Instrument Controller.'?In\na workstation environment, CDS launches thusly:?1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument\ncontroller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey network, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?2. The network\nreplies 'You, silly. You ARE <OriginalName>!'.?3. CDS says, 'Ahh yes, I see that - I have found the license\nserver at <OriginalName> and I will launch.'?TYPICAL PROBLEM/SCENARIO:?Problems arise, however,\nwhen the computer HOSTNAME is changed AFTER OpenLAB had been installed. When the HOSTNAME is\nchanged (perhaps by the customer's IT department), the shared services entry in the CDS does not. So the\nCDS has no idea that it needs to go somewhere else to find the required servers. The conversation is\nthus:?1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument controller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey\nnetwork, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?2. The network replies 'I have no idea what\n<OriginalName> is, that host does not exist on the network.'?3. CDS says, 'Dang, well I guess I can't start\nthen because my license server and instrument controller are missing. Woe is me.'?SYMPTOMS:C.01.05\nexhibits TWO classic symptoms whenever the Instrument Controller and License Server cannot be\nresolved:?1. The OpenLAB Control Panel becomes unresponsive. It will alternate between 10 seconds of\ncompletely unresponsive 'Not Responding' status. Then a flash moment where the software seems to work\nfine.
