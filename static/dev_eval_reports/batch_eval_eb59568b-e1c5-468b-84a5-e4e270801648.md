# Batch Evaluation Report

## Query

what is ilab

## Parameters

- Temperature: 0.3
- Top P: 1
- Max Tokens: 1000
- Runs: 2

## Prompt Evaluation

[RAG3] 1. **Analysis of how the parameter differences affected the outputs:**
   - Both batches have identical parameter settings (System Prompt: Default prompt, Temperature: 0.3, Top P: 1, Max Tokens: 1000) and produced the same sample response.
   - Since there are no differences in parameters or outputs between BATCH 1 and BATCH 2, we can conclude that the consistency in responses is due to identical settings.

2. **Which parameter settings worked better for this query and why:**
   - Given that both batches used the same parameters and generated identical responses, it is clear that these specific settings (Temperature: 0.3, Top P: 1) were effective for this query.
   - The low temperature setting (0.3) likely contributed to more deterministic and focused responses, which is suitable for factual queries like "what is iLab."

3. **Recommendations for optimal parameters for similar queries:**
   - For factual or informational queries where accuracy and consistency are crucial:
     - **Temperature:** Keep it low (around 0.2-0.4) to ensure less randomness in responses.
     - **Top P:** Set at 1 to consider all possible tokens during generation but prioritize those with higher probabilities.
     - **Max Tokens:** Adjust based on expected length of response; here, 1000 tokens seem sufficient.
     - Ensure other relevant settings such as repetition penalties are also tuned appropriately to avoid redundant information.

Overall, maintaining a lower temperature setting while allowing a broad range of token consideration helps generate accurate and reliable answers for factual inquiries like those about software platforms or technical definitions [1].
