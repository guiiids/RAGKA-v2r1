What is this?\n\nResolution or Recommendation:\nLOB_TS references are in both the BPMOracleCreate.sql and BPMOracleUpdate341_360.sql scripts and \nare referenced in the table creation SQL where LOBs are in the table definition.\n\nThe BPM 3.4.1 BPMOracleCreate.sql also uses the same syntax, so this is nothing new to BPM 3.6.\n\nIf logged into the instance as the ECM schema user and you do the following query:\nSELECT * FROM USER_JOBS;  \nThis will list the COLUMN_NAME that is a LOB and the TABLESPACE_NAME where it is located. On an \nAgilent test VM, the BPM-related LOBs are all in tablespace ECM_DATA.\n\nIf the question is about having a tablespace associated only with the LOB objects, it appears these are \npart of the existing ECM tablespaces.\n\nAuthor: K.Takayama\nReference Ticket ID: SID-47849\n\nKeywords: blob, clob, large object\n\n☐ Customer KB           ☒ Internal-only KB\n\nAttachments:\nimage2021-12-22_15-9-58.png (image/png) \nimage2021-12-22_15-10-6.png (image/png) \nimage2021-12-22_15-10-26.png (image/png) \nimage2021-12-22_15-10-55.png (image/png) \n\nKB1015211533 OpenLab BPM – What is LOB_TS\n20 April 2022 14:46\n\n   ECM Page 1    \n\nfile://///csntap20h-nas-1-cifs-nfs-lif2.cos.agilent.com/GISTnotes/attachments/78123376/78123379.png\nfile://///csntap20h-nas-1-cifs-nfs-lif2.cos.agilent.com/GISTnotes/attachments/78123376/78123380.png\nfile://///csntap20h-nas-1-cifs-nfs-lif2.cos.agilent.com/GISTnotes/attachments/78123376/78123381.png\nfile://///csntap20h-nas-1-cifs-nfs-lif2.cos.agilent.com/GISTnotes/attachments/78123376/78123382.png</source>\n\n<source id=\"5\">Product Version:  CDS 2.5\n\nKB0111231616 \n\nGeneral Description/Summary:\nThe Content Management Search Services log file is getting large enough to impact our server, \nalmost 30GB.
