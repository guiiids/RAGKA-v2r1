# Enhanced Memory Management for RAG Assistant

This project implements an enhanced memory management solution for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) assistant with conversation history. The solution addresses the problem of context overflow by implementing smart context summarization that preserves critical information.

## Problem

In conversational AI systems with memory, as the conversation grows longer, the context window becomes full. Traditional approaches simply truncate older messages, which can lead to:

1. Loss of important product information mentioned earlier
2. Loss of citation references
3. Inconsistent responses due to missing context
4. Degraded user experience

## Solution

The enhanced memory management solution uses smart context summarization to:

1. Preserve key information from older messages
2. Maintain all citation references in their original form
3. Keep product-specific information intact
4. Reduce token usage while maintaining conversation coherence

## Implementation

The implementation consists of the following components:

1. **Summarization Settings**: Configuration options to control the summarization behavior
2. **Summarization Method**: A method that summarizes older messages while preserving key information
3. **Enhanced Trim History**: A modified history trimming method that uses summarization instead of simple truncation
4. **Settings Integration**: Integration with the existing settings system

## Usage

### Basic Usage

The enhanced memory management is enabled by default. To use it, simply initialize the RAG assistant as usual:

```python
from rag_assistant_v2 import FlaskRAGAssistant

# Initialize with default settings (summarization enabled)
rag_assistant = FlaskRAGAssistant()

# Use the RAG assistant as usual
answer, cited_sources, _, _, _ = rag_assistant.generate_rag_response("What are the key features of the Agilent 1290 Infinity II LC System?")
```

### Custom Configuration

You can customize the summarization behavior through settings:

```python
rag_assistant = FlaskRAGAssistant(settings={
    "max_history_turns": 5,  # Number of conversation turns to keep without summarization
    "summarization_settings": {
        "enabled": True,                # Whether to use summarization (vs. simple truncation)
        "max_summary_tokens": 800,      # Maximum length of summaries
        "summary_temperature": 0.3      # Temperature for summary generation
    }
})
```

### Disabling Summarization

If you prefer the original truncation behavior, you can disable summarization:

```python
rag_assistant = FlaskRAGAssistant(settings={
    "summarization_settings": {
        "enabled": False  # Fall back to simple truncation
    }
})
```

## Testing

A test script is provided to demonstrate the functionality:

```bash
python test_smart_memory.py
```

This script simulates a conversation with multiple turns and shows how the summarization is triggered when the history exceeds the configured limit.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Context Preservation**: Critical information from earlier in the conversation is preserved
2. **Citation Integrity**: All citation references are maintained for proper attribution
3. **Product Information Retention**: Specific product details mentioned earlier remain available
4. **Token Efficiency**: Reduces token usage while maintaining conversation coherence
5. **Better User Experience**: Provides more consistent responses by preserving important context

## Limitations

1. **Additional API Call**: Summarization requires an additional API call, which may increase latency
2. **Summary Quality**: The quality of the summary depends on the LLM's summarization capabilities
3. **Trade-offs**: There's a balance between summary length and information preservation

## Future Improvements

1. **Adaptive Summarization**: Adjust summarization parameters based on conversation characteristics
2. **Selective Summarization**: Only summarize parts of the conversation that are less relevant
3. **Multi-level Summarization**: Use multiple levels of summarization for very long conversations
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Add metrics to evaluate the quality of summaries
