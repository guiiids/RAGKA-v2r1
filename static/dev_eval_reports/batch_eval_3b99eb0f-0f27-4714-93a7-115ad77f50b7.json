In \nthis context, exiting from either the FID display or lock display of acqi counts \nas an abort. Only the status from the last abort can be displayed.\n\nExamples: ihwinfo('startup') \nihwinfo('abort') \n\nSee also: VnmrJ Liquids NMR \n\nil Interleave arrayed and 2D experiments (P)\n\nDescription: Controls experimental interleaving in arrayed experiments. When interleaving \nis active, bs transients are performed for each member of the array, followed by \nbs more transients for each member of the array, and so on, until nt transients \nhave been collected for each member of the array. Thus, il is only relevant if \nbs is less than nt. \n\nValues: 'y' turns on interleaving and 'n' turns off interleaving.\n\nSee also: VnmrJ Liquids NMR  \n\nilfid Interleave FIDs during data processing (C)\n\nDescription: Converts a multiple FID element into a single FID. It is possible to effectively \nextend the Nyquist frequency (i.e., increase the effective spectral width sw) by \nacquiring a number of FIDs with different tau2 values and then reprocessing the \ndata. ilfid does the necessary processing of time-domain data to achieve this \nextension, assuming that a pulse sequence (not supplied) has been written to \ngenerate the required data.\n\nWhen invoked in an experiment of nf FIDs, each of np points, ilfid sorts \nthe data into a single FID of np*nf points that can then be transformed. The \ninterleaving takes the first complex point of each of the nf FIDs and places \nthem in sequential order in the new FID. It then takes the second complex point \nfrom each of the nf FIDs and appends them sequentially to the new FID. This \noperation is repeated for all complex points.

What is this?\n\nResolution or Recommendation:\nLOB_TS references are in both the BPMOracleCreate.sql and BPMOracleUpdate341_360.sql scripts and \nare referenced in the table creation SQL where LOBs are in the table definition.\n\nThe BPM 3.4.1 BPMOracleCreate.sql also uses the same syntax, so this is nothing new to BPM 3.6.\n\nIf logged into the instance as the ECM schema user and you do the following query:\nSELECT * FROM USER_JOBS;  \nThis will list the COLUMN_NAME that is a LOB and the TABLESPACE_NAME where it is located. On an \nAgilent test VM, the BPM-related LOBs are all in tablespace ECM_DATA.\n\nIf the question is about having a tablespace associated only with the LOB objects, it appears these are \npart of the existing ECM tablespaces.\n\nAuthor: K.Takayama\nReference Ticket ID: SID-47849\n\nKeywords: blob, clob, large object\n\n☐ Customer KB           ☒ Internal-only KB\n\nAttachments:\nimage2021-12-22_15-9-58.png (image/png) \nimage2021-12-22_15-10-6.png (image/png) \nimage2021-12-22_15-10-26.png (image/png) \nimage2021-12-22_15-10-55.png (image/png) \n\nKB1015211533 OpenLab BPM – What is LOB_TS\n20 April 2022 14:46\n\n   ECM Page 1    \n\nfile://///csntap20h-nas-1-cifs-nfs-lif2.cos.agilent.com/GISTnotes/attachments/78123376/78123379.png\nfile://///csntap20h-nas-1-cifs-nfs-lif2.cos.agilent.com/GISTnotes/attachments/78123376/78123380.png\nfile://///csntap20h-nas-1-cifs-nfs-lif2.cos.agilent.com/GISTnotes/attachments/78123376/78123381.png\nfile://///csntap20h-nas-1-cifs-nfs-lif2.cos.agilent.com/GISTnotes/attachments/78123376/78123382.png</source>\n\n<source id=\"4\">Agilent Knowledge Base Article\n\niLab FAQs\nAuthor: guivieiraa | Created: 2023-12-04\nSource URL: https://nextgen-community.agilent.com/technical/ilab---stage-environment-testing/w/resources/20029/ilab-faqs\n\nNote: This is a text-only fallback PDF.
